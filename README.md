React Application README
========================

Getting Started
---------------

To run this React application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory
3. Start the application by running `npm start`

This will start the development server and make the application available at `http://localhost:3000`.

About the Application
---------------------

This is a basic React application that demonstrates a simple layout with a header, footer, and main application component. It also includes an example React Hook for state management.

Application Structure
--------------------

* `public/index.html`: The main HTML template for the application
* `src/index.js`: The main entry point for the React application
* `src/components/`: Importable components:
    + `App.js`: The main application component (exposes `App`)
    + `Header.js`: The header component for the application (exposes `Header`)
    + `Footer.js`: The footer component for the application (exposes `Footer`)
* `src/hooks/`: Importable React Hooks:
    + `useSomething.js`: An example React Hook for state management (exposes `useSomething`)
* `src/setupTests.js`: Jest configuration for unit testing
* `src/style.css`: Global CSS styles for the application

Running Tests
-------------

To run the unit tests, use the command `npm test`. This will execute the tests configured in `src/setupTests.js`.

Available Components and Hooks
-----------------------------

* `import { App } from './src/components/App.js';`
* `import { Header } from './src/components/Header.js';`
* `import { Footer } from './src/components/Footer.js';`
* `import { useSomething } from './src/hooks/useSomething.js';`

You can import and use these components and hooks in your React application.
